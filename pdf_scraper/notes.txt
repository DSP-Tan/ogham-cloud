When you get the bounding box of a block of text, and use that to sort the position of the text, sometimes
the text has loads of empty lines at the start, so that the bbox starts much higher up than the text. This 
gives a false sense of where the text should be in ordering. 

Perhaps you should redetermine the bboxes for each box to be the bboxes of the first and last non-empty lines. 


A function which works on "lines" rather than "line" is a block function and not a lines funciton.
